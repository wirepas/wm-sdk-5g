# Wirepas SDK for 5G

This repository contains Wirepas SDK, which allows the development of an application
to be executed on the same chip as Wirepas Stack.
This application is often referred as a _Single-MCU application_.


> :warning:

> _To use the SDK, you need to have access to the Wirepas binaries. You need to have a
> software license agreement (SLA) with Wirepas to get them. If you would like to become

## Overview

The following diagram, describes the main components of the SDK.

![Main components][here_main_components]


## Documentation

The documentation for this SDK is written with Doxygen and generated in HTML format.

It is hosted [here](https://wirepas.github.io/wm-sdk-5g/).
You can select the desired version depending on the SDK version you are working on.

Some information is available on this page too, but it is just a subset of what the html documentation
contains.

## Wirepas binaries

As a Wirepas SLA licensee, you should have received access to protected zipped archive containing the Wirepas binaries.

Put the archive to the root of [image_folder][here_image], the build script
will automatically extract binaries and configuration files to the correct
location.

You can also extract the archive to the same location, but it is not necessary.

## Environment

This SDK relies on GNU Arm toolchain. To use the SDK you will need to fulfill the following requirements:

1. GCC Arm toolchain
2. The make tool
3. python 3.x
4. pycryptodome package for python (_can be installed with pip_)

In order to validate that your environment is correctly configured, you should be able to build the custom_app application.

> [!NOTE]
> Wirepas offers a Docker container that encapsulates a complete build environment, ensuring all necessary dependencies are pre-installed and configured for seamless development.

For more information and select correct software version, please refer to [How to install Compilation Tools](https://developer.wirepas.com/support/solutions/articles/77000560719-how-to-install-compilation-tools-) document.

## How to build an application

This SDK supports multiple target boards. All of them are listed under [board folder][here_board] and can be selected with target_board=<target_board>

This SDK contains multiple application examples that can be found under [source folder][here_source] and can be selected with app_name=<app_name>

> :warning:
>
> The first time you'll build an application, you'll be prompted to choose bootloader keys.
> Once chosen the first time, they will be used for all your images and must be kept secret
> and in a safe place where they will not be lost or deleted.  It is also possible to define
> keys per application.

To build the _custom_app_ application for a given board, please execute following command.

```shell
    make app_name=custom_app target_board=<board_name>
```

You can customize verbosity of the log with the option V=value. Value can be 0 (default), 1 for more build info and 2 for even more build info.

After execution of this command, you should find the _final_image_custom_app.hex_ under _build/<board_name>/custom_app_ folder.
