/* Linker script for Wirepas Mesh bootloader on nRF9161
 *
 * This file is for the 1024 kB Flash, 256 kB RAM variant
 *
 * Flash is split into:
 *  - Bootloader executable code (BOOTLOADER)
 *  - Bootloader config: memory areas, auth. and encryption keys (BLCONFIG)
 *
 * RAM is split into:
 *  - RAM for bootloader variables, to support runtime services (BL_STATIC)
 *  - RAM for Wirepas Mesh stack that is retained over boots (RETAINED_RAM)
 *      - This area is not to be altered by the bootloader
 *  - Rest of the RAM the bootloader can use for variables during booting (RAM)
 *      - Limited to 29 kB here, in case a smaller RAM variant is introduced
 *  - Stack for the bootloader to use only during booting (BL_STACK)
 *      - Separate from regular stack, to protect stack traces during development
