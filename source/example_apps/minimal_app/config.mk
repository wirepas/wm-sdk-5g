# For running this application with network encryption, the following key definitions may be uncommented and
# filled with random data (exactly 16 bytes each). Also `allow_insecure_key_injection` needs to be set
# to 'yes'. Note that the keys end up as plaintext in device flash with this mechanism. Not for
# production use!
#
# For production use, use a secure provisioning method or refer to the app_setup library in the SDK.
